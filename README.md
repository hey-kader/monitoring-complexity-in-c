# Comparing complexity of popular sorting algorithms

### bubble sort O(n^2)

##### slowest sorting algorithm
##### should only be implemented for pedagogical reasons

### quick sort o(n log n)

##### logarithmically scales, but always takes one pass more than log(n)
##### recursive sort which is most often used in scaled processes

### merge sort 

##### I think this is also n*log(n), only merge sort is more effective
##### than quick sort when the list is partially sorted, or closer than not

### insertion sort

##### comparable to merge sort, another fairly arbitrary sorting algorithm

### shell sort

##### created by shell, implemented in K&R as an improvement to bubblesort
##### generally faster than O(n^2) but not as fast as O(n log n)
